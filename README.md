# responsive-portfolio

My portfolio website written in HTML, CSS and JS conatining a bit about myself including skills, education, experience and passion projects.

The site will load without the need for any third party dependencies but does utilize an icon library called Font Awesome for the icons, which I have imported in the head of the index.html file.
The library loads up automatically using CDN so no need to install anything.
